\subsection{Our Unique Environment}
\begin{description}
	\item[Mission] Our mission is to incubate technically excellent, highly ethical, can-do computer professionals who will learn, lead, and serve from a Biblical worldview. To this end, we focus on the unchanging fundamentals of computer science and emphasize Christian character and ethical behavior.
	\item[Over-the-Shoulder Teaching] Involved students learn best. Consequently, most courses are taught in the lab with each student fully engaged with the computer while the subject is being taught. The faculty typically “coach” over the shoulder as opposed to delivering only standard lectures. This teaching method gives our graduates an “edge” in the workplace.
	\item[Small Class Size] Computer classes do not exceed 24 students per class and are usually smaller.
	\item[Emphasis on Teamwork] Teamwork is critical to success in the information technology workplace. For this reason, our courses stress teamwork in-class assignments. Students learn to apply team dynamics to accomplish complex tasks.
	\item[Focus on the Real World] Our goal is to produce well-rounded graduates who can succeed in the real world.  To this end, each student must complete a year-long, senior project under the direction of a mentor and defend it orally. During the project, each student must demonstrate independent research, self-learn the skills needed, then design and complete the project to the customer’s satisfaction.  Each must also pass a comprehensive exit exam.
	\item[Graduate Program] Students can earn a master’s degree in CS with only one additional year of school.
