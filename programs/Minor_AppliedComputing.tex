Notes:%
\begin{enumerate}\footnotesize
	\item Math 110 or higher is a prerequisite and satisfies the Math Liberal Arts Core.
	\item Computer courses should generally be taken in the order listed due to prerequisites.
	\item Courses used in the major cannot be duplicated in the minor.
	\item Graduates must meet residency requirements. The current catalogâ€™s residency requirements are: 36 of the last 46 hours must be earned while attending CSU. Of these, at least 12 hrs must be 300-400 level courses in the major, and at least 6 hrs must be 300-400 level courses in the minor.
	\item In cases of conflict between this checklist and the catalog, the catalog takes precedence.
