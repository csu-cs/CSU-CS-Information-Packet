\section*{Master of Science: Computer Science}

The Master of Science in Computer Science degree is designed to provide an advanced understanding of the technical fundamentals of computer science - architecture, database, networking, and software engineering. The non-thesis program of study is designed to enhance professional development for those currently working in the field while providing advanced skills and knowledge to those seeking employment in the field. The thesis program of study provides the basis for further advanced study in the field. Reflected in the programs of study is a commitment to the highest ethical, intellectual and social values.

Notes:%
\begin{enumerate}\footnotesize
	\item To earn a Master of Science in Computer Science from Charleston Southern University (CSU), a student must form a graduation committee and pass either a Written Final Examination (non-thesis track) or a Thesis Review (thesis track).
	\item In cases of conflict between this checklist and the catalog, the catalog takes precedence.
